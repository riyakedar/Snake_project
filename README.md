                                                        Snake Game


Here's a simple Python Snake game using the `turtle` module. The game includes logic for food collection, increasing the snake's length, and collision detection. 

To make this work, you need to have Python installed along with the `turtle` module (which is part of the standard library). Below is the complete code for a dynamic and interactive Snake game:

### Key Features:
1. **Game Controls**: You can control the snake using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys (up, left, down, right).
2. **Food Collision**: The snake collects food, and each time the snake eats food, it grows in length and the food moves to a new random location.
3. **Collision Detection**: If the snake collides with itself or the screen boundary, the game resets with the snake starting at the center.
4. **Speed Increase**: The game speed increases as the snake grows.

### How to Play:
1. Run the script.
2. Use the `W` key to move up, `A` to move left, `S` to move down, and `D` to move right.
3. The goal is to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls or yourself.

Enjoy the game!
